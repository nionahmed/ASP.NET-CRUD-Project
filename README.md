## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database through a web application using API calls. It provides a simple yet powerful example of how to perform basic database operations via HTTP requests.

## Features

- **Create:** Add new records to the database by sending POST requests to the API endpoint.
- **Read:** Retrieve data from the database using GET requests to the API endpoint.
- **Update:** Modify existing records by sending PUT requests to the API endpoint.
- **Delete:** Remove records from the database with DELETE requests to the API endpoint.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** [C#]
- **Web Framework:** [ASP.NET(core)]
- **Database:** [Microsost SQL Server]
- **API:** [RESTful API]
